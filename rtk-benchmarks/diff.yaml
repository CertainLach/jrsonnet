description: "Comparing rtk diff with tk diff using mock Kubernetes cluster."

# Diff benchmarks use pre-existing test fixtures, not generated ones
fixtures_dir: "cmds/rtk/tests/testdata/diff"

# Each test fixture directory contains:
#   environment/ - the Tanka environment
#   cluster/     - YAML files representing cluster state (served by mock-k8s-server)

tests:
  - name: "cluster_scoped"
  - name: "configmap_unchanged"
  - name: "deployment_nested_changes"
