== What is it

https://jsonnet.org/[Jsonnet] is a data templating language

This Rust crate implements both jsonnet library and an alternative `jsonnet` executable based on it.
For more information see <<bindings,Bindings>>.

== Install

=== NixOS

jrsonnet is packaged in nixpkgs and maintained by @CertainLach

[source,sh]
----
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.jrsonnet
----

=== MacOS

jrsonnet is packaged to brew and maintained by @messense

[source,sh]
----
brew install jrsonnet
----

=== Windows/other linux distributions

You can get latest build of jrsonnet in https://github.com/CertainLach/jrsonnet/releases[releases].

=== Build from sources

jrsonnet should build on latest stable Rust version (probably on the oldest, but there is no MSRV policy provided)

Debug build will work too, but it is much slower than release

[source]
----
cargo build --release
----

== Why?

There already are multiple implementations of this standard implemented in different languages:

* https://github.com/google/jsonnet[C++];
* https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/[Go];
* https://github.com/databricks/sjsonnet[Scala].
* [NEW] https://github.com/eduardosm/rsjsonnet[Another Rust impl appears].

This implementation shows performance better than all existing implementations.
For more information see link:./docs/benchmarks.md[benchmarks]

Also, I wanted to experiment on new syntax features, and jrsonnet implements some of them.
For more information see link:./docs/features.adoc[features]

In the end, it's always fun to implement something in Rust.

== Bindings [[bindings]]

=== Rust

image:https://img.shields.io/crates/v/jrsonnet-evaluator[alt=crates.io, link=https://crates.io/crates/jrsonnet-evaluator]
image:https://docs.rs/jrsonnet-evaluator/badge.svg[alt=docs.rs, link=https://docs.rs/jrsonnet-evaluator]

Jrsonnet is written in rust itself, so just add it as dependency

=== Python

image:https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rjsonnet[alt=crates.io, link=https://pypi.org/project/rjsonnet/]

Bindings are created and maintained by @messense

=== C/C++

Jrsonnet provides a standard `libjsonnet.so` shared library and should work as drop-in replacement for it

=== Other

WASM bingings are also available, Java bindings (Both JNI and WASM compiled to `.class`) are in progress

See link:./bindings/[bindings] for more information.
