# NOTE: This library may panic, and it is only safe to panic in FFI contexts when library is built in panic="abort" mode,
# which is set for release builds of this library.
# FIXME: Move this warning somewhere else, or remove panics from this library (It is not always possible, in some cases
# there is nothing to report the error, in those cases use `abort()`)
# NOTE: This library assumes the allocator is libc malloc or alternative, which does track allocation size for user,
# see TODO in `jsonnet_realloc`.
