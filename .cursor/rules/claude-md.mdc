# CLAUDE.md Guidelines

Always read and follow the `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of the repository strictly. This file contains critical project-specific guidelines, conventions, and instructions that must be adhered to when working on this codebase.

Before making any changes or suggestions, review `CLAUDE.md` for:
- Build and test commands
- Code style and conventions
- Project-specific rules and constraints
- Architecture decisions
