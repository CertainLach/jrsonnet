  test2: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will
    also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The
    user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A
    common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes
    system.
